# dahliaOS dotfiles
Dotfiles for creating a daily-drivable Hyprland setup that resembles dahliaOS in its looks. What is dahliaOS, you might ask? It is a fully custom operating system based on Linux using Flutter for its UI, giving everything a really clean Material style. Unfortunately the project is not in a usable state, but this is where I got the inspiration from to make this. You can read more about it **[here](https://dahliaos.io/)**.
